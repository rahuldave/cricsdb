# Narrowing audit — coverage matrix (feature × API × test)

**What this is.** Every cohort/comparison surface in the app, organised by
page → tab/subtab → feature (headline **tile**, **graph**, or **sparkline**),
with: the API field that feeds it, whether it **narrows** under the six
filters, and which integration test locks that behaviour. Built 2026-05-29
from a DOM-level audit (`agent-browser`, surface by surface) — job 2 of the
post-3e plan.

**The six** = venue / opponent / team / inning / toss / result.

**The rule.** Every headline number, graph, and **sparkline** must narrow
under the six — EXCEPT:
- the per-position / per-over **mix histogram** (the weighting) — stays
  COARSE by design (Tier 2, `spec-tier3-cohort-narrowing.md` §1/D-B1);
- the **gender-global grey** static sparkline line — scope-independent by
  design.

**Audit verdict (2026-05-29): PASS.** Every tile, graph and sparkline that
should narrow was confirmed moving at the rendered-DOM level; the mix
histograms correctly stay coarse. **No frozen surface found** — the prime
watch-item (the green sparkline cohort line) narrows on all of batting /
bowling / fielding / teams. See `narrowing-audit-findings.md` (empty of bugs).

Anchor players: Kohli `ba607b88`, Bumrah `462411b3`, Dhoni `4a8a2e3b`,
Pant `919a3be2`. Stable scope used: `gender=male&team_type=club&tournament=IPL`.

Legend — **Narrows?**: ✅ narrows (Tier 1) · 🟰 coarse-by-design (exception) ·
❄️ frozen (→ findings). **Test asserts narrowing?**: ✓ yes · ~ presence/structure
only · ✗ none (gap).

## Pages with NO cohort surface (nothing to narrow)

`/series` (Tournaments — dossier, leaderboards, by-tier cards),
`/venues`, `/head-to-head` (StatCards + bar/donut, no cohort overlay),
`/matches` + `/matches/:id`. These carry charts/tables but **no comparison
baseline** that responds to the six. Confirmed by grep: none of their
component subtrees use `MetricDelta` / `ProbChip` / `DistributionSparkline` /
`PerformanceVsCohort` / `referenceData`. (Their own non-cohort behaviour is
tested by `series*.sh`, `venues.sh`, `head_to_head.sh`, `matches.sh`.)

## Gaps found → action (closed 2026-05-29)

1. **Sparkline cohort-line narrowing** — no test asserted the green line
   MOVES under the six (`sparkline_league_reference.sh` only checks
   presence + value at a fixed scope). **Closed:** added
   `tests/integration/sparkline_narrowing.sh` — asserts the green line's y1
   moves + legend tracks the API scope_avg under inning, for batting /
   bowling / fielding (legend-anchored) and the three team panels
   (y1-move). 15/15 pass.

2. **Stale denominator-B assertion** — `dismissed_position_chart.sh` A7
   computed the opener player catches/match as `catches / matches.value`
   (squad), but the UI divides by `matches_fielded` (denominator-B, 3e).
   They diverged once the 2026-05-29 re-ingest left Kohli fielding 279 of 280
   IPL matches (37/280=0.132 vs 37/279=0.133 on screen). Red→green: fixed A7
   to divide by `matches_fielded`. The surface itself narrows fine (the
   narrowing assertions C12 etc. were green throughout); only the test's
   denominator was stale.

## Suite confirmation (2026-05-29, all green)

Ran the per-tab narrowing suites as authoritative DOM confirmation — all
PASS: `player_baseline_chart_overlays` (34), `player_baseline_by_phase_chips`
(38), `position_distribution_chart` (14), `over_distribution_chart` (11),
`dismissed_position_chart` (16, after fix), `batting_by_over_charts` (5),
`fielding_by_over_charts`, `fielding_by_phase_charts` (6),
`batting_inter_wicket_cohort` (3), `dismissal_cohort` (11),
`prob_chip_baselines` (13), `prob_chip_baselines_teams` (17),
`team_class_per_tab_narrowing`, `sparkline_league_reference` (9),
`sparkline_narrowing` (15, NEW).

No other gaps: every narrowing surface now has a dedicated test that asserts
movement under the six (or under team_class/series_type for teams).
